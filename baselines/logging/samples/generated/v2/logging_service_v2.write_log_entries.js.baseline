   *  entries in this list that do not include values for their corresponding

   *  The supplied values are chosen so that, among the log entries that did not
   *  supply their own values, the entries earlier in the list will sort before
   *  the entries later in the list. See the `entries.list` method.
   *  Log entries with timestamps that are more than the
   *  logs retention period (/logging/quota-policy) in the past or more than
   *  24 hours in the future will not be available when calling `entries.list`.
   *  However, those log entries can still be
   *  exported with LogSinks (/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs).

   *  quota limit (/logging/quota-policy) for calls to `entries.write`,
