{%- macro operationsServiceMethods() -%}
{#-
  This part will be added into src/version/client.ts.
  If the --service-yaml contains "google.longrunning.Operations", it means the client requires Operations methods [getOperation, listOperationsAsync, cancelOperation, deleteOperation].
  OperationsClient is created for the client in the constructor.
  [getOperation, deleteOperation, cancelOperation, listOperationsAsync] methods are created which is calling the corresponding methods from OperationsClient in google-gax. Note that since the listOperations method is a paginated
  method, we default to using listOperationsAsync for ease of use.

/**
   * Gets the latest state of a long-running operation.  Clients can use this
   * method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API
   * service.
   *
   * @param {Object} request - The request object that will be sent.
   * @param {string} request.name - The name of the operation resource.
   * @param {Object=} options
   *   Optional parameters. You can override the default settings for this call,
   *   e.g, timeout, retries, paginations, etc. See [gax.CallOptions]{@link
   *   https://googleapis.github.io/gax-nodejs/global.html#CallOptions} for the
   *   details.
   * @param {function(?Error, ?Object)=} callback
   *   The function which will be called with the result of the API call.
   *
   *   The second parameter to the callback is an object representing
   * [google.longrunning.Operation]{@link
   * external:"google.longrunning.Operation"}.
   * @return {Promise} - The promise which resolves to an array.
   *   The first element of the array is an object representing
   * [google.longrunning.Operation]{@link
   * external:"google.longrunning.Operation"}. The promise has a method named
   * "cancel" which cancels the ongoing API call.
   *
   * @example
   * ```
   * const client = longrunning.operationsClient();
   * const name = '';
   * const [response] = await client.getOperation({name});
   * // doThingsWith(response)
   * ```
